# CineViews – Full-Stack Movie Review Platform

CineViews is a full-featured movie review web application where users can browse movies, read/write reviews, and see community ratings. It includes secure user authentication, admin-only routes for managing movies and genres, and a full password reset system with expiring tokens via email.

This project was built from scratch using raw PHP, AltoRouter, Plates (PHP template engine), and MySQL — as a semester-long capstone at Central Community College. It earned **perfect scores across all evaluation stages** and **high praise from the instructor**. The full site was completed in ~2–3 weeks.

## Dependency Management (Composer)

This project uses Composer to manage dependencies. Required packages include:

- [`altorouter/altorouter`](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter) – lightweight routing library
- [`league/plates`](https://platesphp.com/) – native PHP templating engine

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
composer install
```

## Structure
```
CineViews/
├── index.php                     # Main router and route map (AltoRouter)
├── database.php                  # All DB interaction functions
├── templates/                    # All Plates-based views
├── vendor/                       # Altorouter, Composer, League, and Templates
├── .htaccess                     # Redirects all non-file requests to index.php (for clean routing)
├── composer.json                 # Lists required PHP packages and project metadata
├── composer.lock                 # Locks exact package versions to ensure consistency
├── SQL_Create_Insert_Script.sql  # SQL script used to initially create the database with sample data
├── user_read.ini                 # DB creds (excluded from repo)
├── user_edit.ini                 # DB creds (excluded from repo)
├── README.md                     # You’re reading it
```

> **Note:** Most of the core logic can be found in:
> - `index.php` – main routing logic and route definitions
> - `database.php` – all database interaction functions
> - `templates/` – all HTML views and dynamic content using Plates templating

## Security & Validation

- Input validation for all user fields
- Password hashing via password_hash()
- Password verification via password_verify()
- Token expiration logic for reset links
- Session-based admin-only gating for privileged routes
- SQL injection protection via prepare() + execute()
